# UCL iGEM's 2020 cellular automata model 



#### You can find 4 folders with CA code at different stages: Backgroung code, 2D code, 3D code and Exploration

####    - The background code shows the original matlab code we took inspiration from to build this model, as well as some original attempts at running this code in python (Jupyter notebooks). If you want to run animations of the CA (i.e. the cells growing), use the figure_gif2.py code.
####    - Under 2D code you can access the furthest developments we reached on a 2D grid, before jumping to three dimensions. This code is great if you want to get a general idea of the model without being too computationally demanding.
####    - Under 3D code you can find the latest version of the model that plots the results straight away. Appart from length of simulation and number of timesteps, it also takes in the size of h (size of each cell in the grid, in metres), which alters the timestep needed to compute diffusions and therefore how computationally expensive the simulation is
####    - The exploration folder is similar to the 3D code folder, however it is coded in so that the results are saved into particular files in your local computer, as well as code to take in previous runs and continue from there.
